Comments in HTML are used to insert notes to a web page. 
They are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
Comments are mainly used to make our code more readable. 
They are completely hidden from the webpage and only show up in the code.
Commenting on your code is a good practice as it helps us to express what the code is doing. 
It can act as an anchor for you if you want to change your code in the future.

We can use ctrl+/ to create a comment in html
<!-- This is a comment -->

HTML tags are the keywords that are used to produce web pages in various formats.
They are like instructions to the web browser about how to format and display the content.
HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content, and closing tag.

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag. For example, 
<p> is the starting tag of a paragraph and </p> is the closing tag of the same paragraph, but <p>This is a paragraph</p> is a paragraph element.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration in HTML is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document.
Itâ€™s not an HTML tag, but an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
