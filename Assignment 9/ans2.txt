Relative Positioning: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. 
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to adjust away from its 
normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

Absolute Positioning: An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However, if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
 Absolute positioning is relative to the position of another, enclosing element.
