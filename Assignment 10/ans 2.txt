justify-content: This property aligns the flexible containerâ€™s items along the main axis when the items do not use all available space. 
It manages the spacing between items and aligns them in various ways, such as centering them, spacing them evenly, 
or aligning them to the start or end.

align-items: This property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox. It controls how items align in the cross 
axis direction (vertical by default). For example, items can be aligned at the start, end, center, or stretched to fill the container.

The gap property in CSS Flexbox is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap, specifying the size of gutters, which is the space between 
rows and columns within grid, flex, and multi-column layouts. 
It sets the values for the row-gap and column-gap properties, which are used to set the spacing between rows and columns of flex items.

flex-direction: This property specifies the direction of the flexible items within a flex container. By default, it is set to row, which means that items are laid out in a row in a left-to-right direction. 
Other possible values include row-reverse, column, and column-reverse.

flex-wrap: This property controls whether flex items are laid out in a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines within a flex container.
 The default value is nowrap, which keeps all items on a single line. Other values include wrap (items wrap onto multiple lines) 
 and wrap-reverse (items wrap onto multiple lines in reverse order).
