    <h2>Fevicon Defination: </h2>
    <p>
        A favicon, short for favorite icon, is a small icon associated with a particular website or web page. 
        It’s typically displayed in the address bar of a browser accessing the site or next to the site name in a user’s list of 
        bookmarks. Favicons are usually 16x16 pixels and can help visitors locate your page easier when they have multiple tabs open.
