Here are some benefits of using meta tags:

Improved Search Engine Visibility: Meta tags can help search engines understand what a page is about, which can lead to 
            better search engine rankings and increased traffic.
Better User Experience: Meta tags can provide users with more information about a page’s content, which can improve click-through 
            rates and overall user experience.
Helping Search Engines Determine the Topic of Your Webpage: Meta tags tell search engines what a webpage is about.
            Search engines use that information to help determine the webpage’s relevance to a query.
Avoiding Duplicate Content Issues: Meta tags are often the first line of defense for duplicate content. 
            If your title tags are the same across many webpages, for example, Google will choose the best webpage among them 
            and filter others from the results.
Driving Clicks and Organic Search Traffic: As mentioned, the right meta data can increase clicks and traffic to your site3
