SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is a set of rules for optimizing your website so that it can achieve 
higher rankings in search engine’s organic results. It’s the process to follow to increase the visibility of your website in 
search engines and get more traffic. SEO has two main goals. The first is to help you understand what users are searching for 
online so that you can create high-quality content to satisfy their intent. The second is to help you create a website that search 
engines can find, index, and understand its content.

The importance of SEO lies in its ability to make your website more visible, which means more traffic and more 
opportunities to convert prospects into customers. It’s a highly effective way to improve your brand’s visibility through search,
 drive more traffic to your website, establish your brand as a trusted authority in your industry, sustainably and reliably grow your 
 business, and much more.
